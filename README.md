What Is Machine Learning:- 
Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data. 
[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P,
if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. 

Why Use Machine Learning:-

1. First you would look at what spam typically looks like. You might notice that some words or 
phrases (such as “4U,” “credit card,” “free,” and “amazing”) tend to come up a lot in the subject.
Perhaps you would also notice a few other patterns in the sender’s name, the email’s body, and so on.
 You would write a detection algorithm for each of the patterns that you noticed, 
 and your program would flag emails as spam if a number of these patterns are detected. 
 3. You would test your program, and repeat steps 1 and 2 until it is good enough.
 Types of Machine Learning Systems:-
 
 Whether or not they are trained with human supervision (supervised,
 unsupervised, semisupervised, and Reinforcement Learning) • Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online versus batch learning) • Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points, or instead detect patterns in the training data and build a predictive model,
 much like scientists do (instance-based versus model-based learning)
